# FAQs

## How are searches counted?

Your Deep Lawn subscription gives you a number of Free Searches per month - they are counted in different ways depending upon how they are performed. 


## Storefront Widget Searches

When a customer visits your website and types their address into the widget for the first time, it will count as one search. After that, repeat searches will not count towards your total. If that customer comes back and types in their address again, it will not count as another search. So if a customer types in their address, then abandons their cart and comes back several more times and keeps typing in their same address - all that only counts as only one search that first time.

## Dashboard Searches

Each time you type in an address into the dashboard search bar, it counts as a search each time. Unlike the Storefront Widget, typing in the same address into the dashboard multiple times will count as multiple searches. In addition, whether you send these searches out as quotes, or not - they still count as a search towards your monthly total.

## Preview Widget Searches

When using the Widget Preview link on the branding tab, each time you type in an address into the Preview Widget, it counts as a search each time. Unlike the Storefront Widget, typing in the same address into the Preview Widget multiple times will count as multiple searches. Because of this, **the Preview Widget should only be used for checking the appearance of your Widget and not performing normal searches.**
