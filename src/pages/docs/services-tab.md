| *Creating a Service from scratch* |

To create a new Service from scratch, begin on the Services Tab and the Services Sub-Tab. Then Click Add new Service.

| *Filling out a Service’s Name, Description and Artwork* |

Give your service a name, description, and upload any associated artwork. Then select which measurement your service uses.

| *Default Lawn Search Measurement Options* |

Next, select what type of measurement will be used to price your service. By default new services will be Lawn Search Type Services. Measurements Lawn and Lot area are always available.

| *Additional Add-on Measurements* |

House Footprint & Perimeter & House Square Footage are available as Add-ons at the additional cost of $0.15 per search.

| *Search Type Toggle & Snow Product Measurements* |

If you have the Snow Product enabled, you can toggle the Search Type to either Lawn of Snow. Snow Services use the measurement types Driveways & Walkways. Driveway uses the square footage of the Driveway, while Walkways uses the square footage of sidewalks and other walkways. Be aware that the Walkways measurement will only automatically measure walkways in the front of the house.

| *Visibility & Enable Service Quantity Toggles* |

The Visibility toggle sets whether a measurement is visible to your customers searching through your Storefront Widget. They will also be hidden when you search through your Preview Widget. Hidden services will still be visible, when you perform internal Dashboard Searches. Many customers use these features to have “special” hidden services that are only available when sending out Quotes through the dashboard. This feature is also often used 




The Enable Service Quantity toggle allows you to prevent customers from purchasing multiple quantities of a service through your Storefront Widget, or if you perform searches through your Preview Widget. You always have the ability to add multiple quantities of a service when performing searches through the dashboard or when creating packages.

To change an existing service from Lawn Area pricing to Lot Area pricing, go to the services tab. On the service you want to change, click the three dots in the upper right hand corner and select edit.


Then, next to the name of the service, you will see a blue box with a white check that says "Lawn Area" - click the dropdown icon next to it and from the drop down menu click "Lot Area". Then click save in the upper right hand corner. That service will now be priced off of Lot Area. I have included some screen shots below.

Yes, the building perimeter measurement is in linear feet. For building total square footage, you want to enable "House Square Footage" instead. It can be found in theIntegrations Tab under add ons listed as House Square Footage shown below:


![space-1.jpg](http://www.storywarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/space-1.jpg)

When that is enabled, you can find "Building Area" on the drop down for pricing services, shown below:

![space-1.jpg](http://www.storywarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/space-1.jpg)

Alternatively, House Footprint is another option. It is just the square footage that the house sits upon, rather than the entire square footage of the home.

Is one of those what you were looking for? 

You can create minimum pricing by setting a fixed price for the first range of a service. In the example below, there is a minimum price of $120 for all lawn 8,000 square feet and below.

## Importing Services

Services can be imported from a Google Sheet
To import a service from a google sheet, first set the sharing options on the sheet so that "Anyone with the link" can view it


![space-1.jpg](http://www.storywarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/space-1.jpg)

![space-1.jpg](http://www.storywarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/space-1.jpg)

Then, when you are pasting the link into Deep Lawn, use the sheet's URL at the top of the browser to copy and paste, rather than the "copy link" button.

### Discounts

#### Discount Recommendations

#

Yes. After you have created your discounts, to make a discount apply to a service or package, edit that service or package.


From there, you will see the "Apply Discount" section. Click the blue "Click here to open discounts" button and the discounts you have created will appear. You can then click the "+ Select" button to apply the appropriate discounts to that service or package. You will know when a discount is active because it will change to a blue highlight with a blue border. Also, you can remove any active discounts by clicking the trash bin icon. I have included a couple of screenshots of this process below on an example package.

Yes, you can do that. If you enable a discount as a "Checkout Discount" then your customers will be required to put in the case-sensitive name of the discount at checkout for it to apply. Like a promo code or discount code. As an example, in the screenshot below "MAGIC10" typed in at checkout would apply a 10% discount.

It is also briefly mentioned in the Discounts tutorial at the 43 second mark.
