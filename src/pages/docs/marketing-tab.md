You can then fill out the name of the template as well as put in the body of the email. {{name}}  will automatically populate the name of the customer who is receiving the quote, while{{company -name}}  will automatically populate your company's name. Use the buttons above the body of the email to make text, bold, Italic, Underlined, or add a hyperlink.

When you have created your templates you can set one of them as the default template.

By clicking the outlined bookmark icon in the upper right hand corner of a template, it will turn a solid gray color. The template with the solid gray bookmark icon will now be the default template for sending out quotes.

To use the templates, perform a dashboard search and send out a quote. At the Estimate summary page, scroll to the bottom. You will find the Email Copy section. The default template will already be populated. You can select other templates by clicking the drop down shown below:

The other templates you have created will then appear in a drop down. Click on the template you wish to use for that quote and it will replace the current template.

Once you have selected the template you want to use, you can then click in the body of the template and make any additional customizations you want for that email. These changes will be seen by your customer, but will not alter the template for the next time you use it.
