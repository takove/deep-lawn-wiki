You can zoom the map in and out using the mouse wheel or the plus and minus buttons in the bottom right hand corner. To create your company's service area click  "add".

Then click on the map to create your first dot. Continuing clicking and adding dots to define your service area. When you are done, click on the first dot again to complete the shape. Once you connect your first set of dots, you can then drag the dots to adjust your service area.
