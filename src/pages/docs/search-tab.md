## Creating Services 

The Search tab allows you to perform internal searches and send out quotes. Be aware that every time an address is searched within the tab, including repeat addresses, it counts as a search towards your monthly total. This is different from the storefront widget where repeat addresses do not count as additional searches towards your monthly search total.

To begin a search, type in an address in the search bar and select the address from the drop down. You will see a preview image of the address and will be prompted to use this image or if you want to use an HD image instead. If you have the snow feature enabled, you will need to select between lawn and snow.

While the AI is measuring your property, you have the option to fill out the customerâ€™s information in the bottom left hand corner.

When the measurement is complete, adjust the measurement using the tools on the right hand side as needed. When you are done, click continue.

## Select Services and Packages Page
