## Add-ons

### Team Members

#### Manager

To add another team member, go to the integrations tab. Under the Add-ons sub-tab at the bottom of the page you will find the Team Members Add-on. You can then add additional accounts as either "Sales" or "Managers". "Sales" has access to orders, can generate measurements, and send quotes. "Managers" have access to everything except the "My Account" page. Additional Team Members cost $15 per month per member. Screenshots below:

When you add a new Team Member, they will receive a confirmation email with a password and activation link.

To set up different pricing for different regions, you will need to enable Geopricing. Many companies use it in a similar way to what you are describing, such as capturing the additional transportation costs for those further away addresses. Geopricing costs $75 a month and can be turned on in the Integrations tab under the Add-Ons sub tab. Screenshot below:

Once Geopricing is enabled, you can assign your services, packages, and discounts to apply only in specific service areas. In your example, you would have services created at the normal rate applied to the core region area, and then the same services created at the higher rate applied to the wider region outside your core area.

Another benefit of Geopricing is that the total number of properties in each service area is calculated and displayed in your service area tab. Another benefit of Geopricing is that the total number of properties in each service area is calculated and displayed in your service area tab.
